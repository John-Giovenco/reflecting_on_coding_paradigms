Is one of these coding paradigms "better" than the other? Why or why not?

    -I don't believe one is better than the other, I think they have different functionality that can be more efficient in different ways.

Given the opportunity to work predominantly using either of these coding paradigms, which seems more appealing? Why?

    -I prefer OOP because I feel like it is more straight forward than functional prompt. I really need more exposure to both to make a decision.

Now being more familiar with these coding paradigms, what tasks/features/pieces of logic would be best handled using functional programming? Object Oriented Programming?

    -For functional programming, I think creating functions to complete tasks or run equations. For OOP, I think organizing data and methods to easily update the data.

Personally, which of these styles takes more work to understand? What should be done in order to deepen understanding related to this paradigm?

    -Functional programming is going to take more work for me to understand. I need more exposure and practice.
